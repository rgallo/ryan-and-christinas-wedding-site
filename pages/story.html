			<p>It was the end of Summer 2010, and so many exciting things were going on: Apple’s first iPad release, Despicable Me hitting theatres, the FIFA World Cup vuvuzela craze, and the beginning of both Christina and Ryan’s last year at Binghamton University. Christina would be finishing up her senior year of undergraduate, and Ryan his last year towards his MBA.</p>
			<p>Christina and Ryan had both attended Binghamton for years, but it wasn’t until October 2, 2010 that their paths would finally cross. They both had plans to attend the same party at University Plaza, at Christina’s friend Peter’s apartment. As soon as Ryan walked in and Christina knew she didn’t recognize him, she decided to find out exactly why he was there:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		“Who do you know here?”<br />
		“Uhm, I know Keith”<br />
		“Keith… who do you know here?”<br />
		“I’m friends with Sarah”<br />
	</p>
</blockquote>
			<p>Now that it was confirmed that Ryan and Keith knew at least one of Christina’s friends, it was safe to chat. They spent the night talking about Binghamton, TV Shows, the LSAT Christina just finished taking the morning before, and the cool new photobooth app Ryan had just downloaded.</p>
			<p>They exchanged numbers at the end of the night, and began speaking regularly right away, but it wasn’t until December 4, 2010 that their friendship turned into a relationship.</p>

			<p>It was the middle of July, and Christina was lamenting to Ryan about how it’s halfway through the summer and they haven’t made it out to the beach yet.</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>“I know - how about we go this weekend? I’ll pack us a bag the night before, and we can go first thing in the morning."</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Christina thought this was so thoughtful of Ryan, but also a little fishy, considering that Ryan is not a huge fan of the beach (or of packing for things the night before). But sure enough, the weekend came, and Ryan made sure to pack their beach bag.</p>
			<p>The next morning, Ryan and Christina were getting some last minute things together for their trip out. Since they were going to the beach, Christina figured she should wear something comfortable. However, not everybody (or, just Ryan) thought that wearing a plain black t-shirt and shorts was a good idea.</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>"Oh… you’re wearing <em>that</em>? Uh. Why don’t you change?"</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>After Ryan’s discreet suggestion that Christina look more presentable, the two lovebirds drove out to Long Beach, to spend the morning at the beach. Once they arrived, Ryan pointed to a less crowded area on the beach past the boardwalk to set up camp. They walked over, started spreading out their sheet, and began settling in. Christina was just about to undress to start sunbathing when she was startled by Ryan’s interruption:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					"NO! Leave your shirt on!" <br />
					"...What?!"<br />
					"Why don’t you go down to the water first?"<br />
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Christina, very confused, walked down to the water. As she turned around, she saw Ryan approach her with a ukelele in hand (and their friend Doug, with camera in hand!). He got down on one knee, and began performing “I Choose You” by Sara Bareilles. Once he finished, he pulled out a ring and asked Christina to spend the rest of her life with him. Instead of saying “Yes” right away, she kissed him and accepted the ring, which Ryan has been assuming as tacit consent ever since.</p>
